Software is modified to work with 1.8" spi instead 1.44".

Also I created pcb with isolated power supply.

And I have also left FTDI323 header on, that way you can reprogram reflow controller.


We have not 2 but 4 versions of software.

v1.2k = just modified to work with my pcb design.

v1.2kg = same as v1.2k but with new graphic temperature.

v1.2kh = same as v1.2k but for halogen floodlight.

v1.2khg = same as v1.2kh, but with new graphic temperature.

Warning: This project operates with possibly lethal mains voltage. 
If you are unsure what to do, don't do it and get help from an experienced tinkerer with professional training.
